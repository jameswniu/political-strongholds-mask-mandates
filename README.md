A Data-Driven Analysis on Efficacy of Mask Mandates in the United States

1.	Introduction:
Because Covid-19 is all inclusive in affecting the way we live and how we live after, we aim to explore public data to solidify or critically analyze claims that our surroundings feed to us. Based on official data collected by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (“CDC”), we would utilize mask mandate as a factor to capture its effect on individual or public health, and to quantify economic, social, and political impacts descriptively and comparatively.

2.	Dataset:
The dataset by the CDC spans 17 months from April 10, 2020 through January 10, 2021 by country by day. Each row represents an individual country for a State on that particular day with Boolean on whether face masks are required in public places. Requirements for face masks have all-encompassing sources and can include executive orders, administrative orders, resolutions, and proclamations.

3.	Data Preparation:
This dataset has 1,594,118 records that is large enough to exceed Excel’s limit (one million records), so we use a simple editor such as Notepad++ to open it.
We first pick out relevant variables only that we can use to describe and analyze such as the State, country, date, and Boolean on whether mask mandate was in effect on that day. We left out other variables such as State and County FIPS codes and URLs to executive orders.
The dataset is grouped by State by County by Month that leaves us with approximately 54,000 records. This data is usable to take into account the timeframe and time lags when considering its healthcare, economic, social, political impacts.
The second usable dataset is grouped by State by County summing days with mask mandate for entire period. This leaves us with approximately 3,200 records. This data is useful for descriptive purposes to summarize and compare if States with more mask mandate days end up better after all.

4.	Research Questions:
James will prepare the data into the two meaningful sets. The group will split up to do the analysis into diverse but overlapping topics. Based on the data each member is going to find for the right-hand side, he or she will merge records and construct descriptive visuals or correlation analysis. This allows each member to delve deeper into his/her topic of interest, facilitates allocation of individual focus in line with GitLab branches and subsequent time management for collaboration.

Plausible Topics of Interest: 
James: Impact of mask mandates on unemployment - does it facilitate or push people away from work?
Impact of mask mandates on federal payouts - does it incentives more payout from the government?

James, again, thanks for the above compilation.

As I mentioned at our last session together, it will be beneficial if we could somehow try to deepen the scope of our project.

To illustrate, let us look at the part of the project that you assigned to yourself:

1) "Impact of mask mandates on unemployment - does it facilitate or push people away from work?" - Could you try and explain how you intend to go about that? Are you suggesting that we should try to correlate unemployment information with mask mandate data? What of other factors that could contribute to unemployment at target period, e.g Lock downs? Each US State implemented different measures to try to mitigate the pandemic. Peculiar measures taken by States affected unemployment in ways that would be next to impossible to gauge objectively or empirically. For example some States ordered restaurants shut at varying periods. Except you want to check all these measures implemented by each State that could have skewed unemployment correlation to mask mandate. Guess what? You will have to do that per day per State. Because those measures themselves varied widely by State, by day. For example in Georgia, our Governor renewed State emergency declarations and mandates several times in accordance with covid data.

2) "Impact of mask mandates on Federal payouts - does it incentives more payout from the government?" - Does this mean we would try to find some kind of relationship between Government assistance and mask mandate during the period? The bulk of the assistance were from the Federal Government. Meanwhile each State implemented its mask mandates as it deemed necessary. How can one possibly relate the two objectively?

My suggestion:
We could try to research the effectiveness of Mask Mandates themselves as you suggested before. E.g How many hospitalizations or deaths did mask mandates actually prevent in each State? We could achieve this by comparing covid-related mortalities for days with mask mandates versus days without. But you have to consider number of days necessary from infection to hospitalization!

 Or we could do some kind of cost-benefit analysis for the mask mandates themselves, considering their impact on the economy.

I will discard (or suspend) the other idea I was suggesting before since it seems there isn't much reception for it. I have gotten some valid data sets for it though, that might prove useful in our project, whichever direction that takes us.

Thank you all,

Best,

Tunde
